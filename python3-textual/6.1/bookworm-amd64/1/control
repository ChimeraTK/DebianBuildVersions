Description: TUI (Text User Interface) framework for Python inspired by modern web development
 Textual uses Rich to render rich text, so anything that Rich can render may be
 used in Textual.
 .
 Event handling in Textual is asynchronous (using async and await keywords).
 Widgets (UI components) can independently update and communicate with each
 other via message passing.
 .
 Textual has more in common with modern web development than it does with
 curses; layout is done with CSS grid and (soon) the theme may be customized
 with CSS. Other techniques are borrowed from JS frameworks such as Vue and
 React.
